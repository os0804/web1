        The <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" title="html wikipedia">HyperText Markup Language</a></strong> or <strong>HTML</strong> is the <u><strong>standard markup language</strong> for documents</u> designed to be displayed in a web browser.<br>
        It defines the content and structure of web content.<br>
        It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

    <p>
        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.<br>
        HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.

        HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.<br>
        With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.<br>
        HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items.<br>
        HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
